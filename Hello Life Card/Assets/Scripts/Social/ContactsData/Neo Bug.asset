  socializeSentence: Oh, your shadow..... Hmmm, I see, what a poor human. You are
    cursed by the moon. Guess I will need to stay around you to prevent you from being
    killed.
  trustIncreaseSentences:
  - I sense some evil power. It seems I need to leave now. Don't follow me, you should
    live a peaceful life like a human. I'm sure we will meet again.
  referSentence: You struggled to live until today. Maybe you are not only a common
    human you seem to be. If you wish, you can fight with me to save this world.
  questions:
  - Tell me, how have you managed to survive until today without my protection. I
    can sense that an evil power is so very close to taking to taking your life it
    seems impossible that you are not dead.
  - 
  - 
  options:
  - I died a while back.
  - Superpowers.
  - My parents died protecting me.
  results:
  - You are undead? I must put you and your evil power to rest.
  - Ah, so you are like me, at some you should help me keep this shadowed world safe.
  - I see, we are more alike than it seems than I lost my parents at a young age too.
    Do not fear though, I can teach you.
