  socializeSentence: Oh, your shadow..... Hmmm, I see, what a poor human. You are
    cursed by the moon. Guess I will need to stay around you to prevent you from being
    killed.
  trustIncreaseSentences:
  - I sense some evil power. It seems I need to leave now. Don't follow me, you should
    live a peaceful life like a human. I'm sure we will meet again.
  - You seem to be surrounded by evil power. Do not worry, I will watch over you today
    human. You have nothing to fear.
  - Why do you seek me out human, my place is in the shadows. I cannot rest until
    my work is done. Until then leave me be.
  referSentence: You struggled to live until today. Maybe you are not only a common
    human you seem to be. If you wish, you can fight with me to save this world.
  questions:
  - 'Tell me, how have you managed to survive until today without my protection. '
  - I can sense that an evil power is so very close to taking to taking your life
    it seems impossible that you are not dead.
  - 
  - Human, stop following me. It will only put yourself in further danger.
  - Why do you follow me incessantly as a shadow follows its caster.
  - 
  options:
  - I died a while back.
  - Superpowers.
  - My parents died protecting me.
  - You are cool.
  - I want to learn from you.
  - I want to kill you.
  results:
  - You are undead? I must put you and your evil power to rest.
  - Ah, so you are like me, at some you should help me keep this shadowed world safe.
  - I see, we are more alike than it seems than I lost my parents at a young age too.
    Do not fear though, I can teach you.
  - I do not understand what you mean by cool. But I appreciate what is likely a compliment.
  - Its too dangerous for normal humans, my job is to protect you. If you truly wish
    to learn you must suffer first.
  - I suppose thats a joke, a very bad joke though.
