  socializeSentence: Oh, your shadow..... Hmmm, I see, what a poor human. You are
    cursed by the moon. Guess I will need to stay around you to prevent you from being
    killed.
  trustIncreaseSentence: I sense some evil power. It seems I need to leave now. Don't
    follow me, you should live a peaceful life like a human. I'm sure we will meet
    again.
  referSentence: You struggled to live until today. Maybe you are not only a common
    human you seem to be. If you wish, you can fight with me to save this world.
