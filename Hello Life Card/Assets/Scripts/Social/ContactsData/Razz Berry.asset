  referSentence: I think you'd be a great Streamer. You'd gain an audience in no time!
    What do you say?
  questions:
  - I've spent so much time streaming every day I forget sometimes that tthere's not
    people watching me.
  - So I end up accidentally blurting out random things in public, or narrating what
    I'm doing.
  - Do you think I should quit being a streamer?
  options:
  - Yeah, work sucks.
  - Nah, its worth the money.
  - Nah, its worth pleasing the people.
  results:
  - Mmm but I really need the money right now. Maybe once I have enough saved up.
  - Yea, even if nothing else at least I'm making money.
  - You're right, my viewers would freak if I just bailed on them.
